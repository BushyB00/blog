Coding can be one of the most stressful things for anyone, whether it be java, python, or even HTML and CSS for web developers. Some people just want a little help, luckily there are some amazing apps that can be used to help Web developers to use make their life's a lot easier. I took the liberty to find three of the best tools that can help make any web dev’s stress’s go away. The first tool is Crucible which is a simple review tool, the next is Github and finally, code climate.

Let’s start off with Crucible, it is a web-based quality tool, it's used to find bugs, review, and discuss possible changes that can help your code improve. This is one of the best tools to use for veterans and newcomers to web development. One more In-depth feature it has is it allows users to track projects in real-time and allows streams showing the latest comments and updates. It also reviews the code overtime to make sure it is current by refactoring and changing it through the review. Overall, this is one of the best programs to be used to help improve any part of your code.

Next is everyone's favorite GitHub. This is one of the if not the most used tools in all of the web development. It is allowing you to upload your code to their cloud and store it and allow you to download it from anywhere and share it with anyone. Not to mention this app is connected or allows connections to many more applications and lets you transfer your repositories to so many apps like netlify. Honestly, GitHub is amazing and if you are not using it you should right away!

Lastly, we have a code climate. This is a self-hosted code platform that allows you to test your code for coverage of security, style, complexity, and much more. It does have you pay to use its cloud; a simple monthly fee is all. Like GitHub climate allows you to push commits to its website it will analyze it and then send you back information to improve on the code over with potential fixes and to make it much better with what you are doing. Code climate is very helpful and can be a very good help, if you are ok with a monthly fee to use their cloud then this tool and be one of the best for you.

I hope these three tools can help you out there when making a new project and continuing old ones. All three have their pros and will make any web developer's life much easier. Github can help store and send your repositories, Code climate can check and analyze your code to be better and crucible will check your code for errors and make sure it's the best it can be. These three tools can help with the quality of life and make sure whatever you are doing will be running smooth and get done much faster.
