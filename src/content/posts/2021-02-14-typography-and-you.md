Typography is the art of using font, color, weight, size, layout, and more to create something with greater meaning. This is what some believe to be 95% of web design and what would take up most of your time as a developer, making it one of the essential things that you will have to do to make an excellent and professional website. There are some worthy ideals to keep in mind when trying to utilize typography. The understanding of what micro and macro typography are and how to use it. What is Sans's serif font and just regular Serif font, what's the difference between the two, and which one should you use? Finally, what are web-safe fonts to be using. 

We are beginning with micro and macro typography. Macro is the focus on the readability of text and what's on the screen. It will focus on word spacing, tracking, filling white space, and margin kerning. These are important for the text to be understood and help people read the text without being hard to follow. Micro is more focused on the formatting and the layout of the words on the web page. Its job is to make sure that different type sizes and the composition relate to one another, the basic dimensions that set the type. These are important because there will be no order to the page without them, and everything will be a jumbled mess. Micro isn't much of a problem in today's modern world and is mainly don't for us or very simplified. Flex boxes, margins, and so on are part of micro and very much of the macro. Most of what we consider to be Web dev today is mainly using macro with tiny micro. Regardless of it is still essential to know the difference and keep them in mind when crafting a new web page.

What is San's serif font and serif font? Let's start with serif. Serif font is a font with extra embellishments at the end of the letters; some people will call them feet or tails. In comparison, San's serif font doesn't have any decorations. This simple detail can set a tone for your website and make it something else. Serif is a paragraph-based font where it is best to describe something or write a paragraph because it is more comfortable to read, while San's is more used for big, bold fonts for headings and titles to entertain or draw in potential readers. It is not best to mix the designs too much but to keep their separate places.

Web-safe fonts are the few basic fonts that are available on most or all computers. Choose these fonts for better control and consistency for your website and make your development process much smoother. Some of the most popular fonts to use are 

* Arial 
* times new roman 
* Verdana 
* Georgia 
* Courier 

It's best to use these fonts as the necessary fonts for your page and at least have one of them be your back up just if something happens and you need to change the font or need another style. 

These ideals are good to keep in mind and help make a new website or help expand on making a current one. Remember what macro and micro are and how they affect your webpage. Make sure that you use San's and serif font in the right way to maximize efficiency, and be sure to use web-safe fonts to make your overall experience more comfortable.
