Animation within web development is some incredible things. You can make fading colors, moving backgrounds, and if you know a little JavaScript, you can take it to the next level and make code that moves and changes based on the user's input. Animations can keep the views attention much more effortless than pictures and might keep them on the web page for much longer. Animations have their benefits in the web development world. As stated before, it can keep the user on the web page for much longer with simple movements and tricks but adding something like a dynamic background can keep people in longer than anything else. You can use the same ideals for loading bars between web pages to see the page load or have something that indicates it is loading to help them stay longer or be entertained by it and give a much more professional look to the page. Animations are good, but they can have their cons, like being too distracting and making it so that the user won't read the page and just look at the nice moving object instead. Overall, the animation is suitable for anyone to use and can make it so that their websites can be much more eye-catching and help make the viewing experience feel more like a journey. 

Animations can help retain attention to the website. Let's first look at background images. A moving background image and be very helpful for any webpage or at least a dynamic one. This can and will help the user stay on the page to view the content much more. A decent example of this is code pen

The background colors of the pen are changing along with the words in the box. This can keep users invested and make them want to explore and see what else the website can show them. There are many more examples to see a background animation or background being dynamic. A good one is [GameFule's.](https://www.gamefuel.com/) The GameFuel's website is showing some excellent animations. When you enter the page, you can see the background moves with the cans moving up and down. As you go up and down on the page, you can see the left side words being type vertically. Go even further down. You can see demonstrated what the can was designed for, showing animations of the lid being open, a joystick moving, and a grid moving. Finally, if you go further down, you can see people they sponsor move right to the left. This webpage is packed full of dynamic backgrounds and will keep people entertained and want to find out more. 

Loading screens can make a webpage much more professional looking. If you combine this with a dynamic background, like right here with this code pen.

You can create some excellent-looking load screens that people can be impressed by and enjoy to their fullest. This will also give your web page a sense of professionalism, making the transition from one page to the next seem livelier than a simple blank screen. The pen above shows this by having the circle on its own be a decent indicator of loading while the background can keep up with them the page's design. Be careful, though. This can cause the page to be slower and can have the animations stutter quite a lot. 

Although animations are good, they can be very distracting and cause the user to only look at them and interact with them. This can make it so that the message that you might want to spread or at least show will be dismissed by something that just looks better. You have to be aware of this and know that moderation is key to a good website. As stated, before animations can make the page much slower. This can also kill the user experience and make them click off instead of staying and see what else is there. The best thing to do is test the animation and see how it runs. If it's slowing everything down, replace it or try to cut down on the code used for it, something you might put in extra features that aren't needed. 

Animation overall can be the most significant thing to make a website look better, feel professional, and make the overall experience feel like a journey the users are having and will remember for a long time. This is great, but if the animation is coming at the expense of the speed of the web page or is distracting from the message you wanted to tell, then it might be best to not have them at all. When adding animations, just remember to try to make them good and fit with the design and make sure they don't break your website.
